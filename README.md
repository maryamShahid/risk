# Risk Game
Risk is a challenging board game that is based on strategy and an attempt to rule the world. It is group 1G's project for Bilkent's CS319 course.

## Description
Our Project is the Classic Risk board game, with some enhancements and additions to make the game even more fun and entertaining. 

The game is centered over the world map in which players have to try and conquer as much of the world as they can. Players are given some infantry at the start of the game depending on the number of the players and after that each player is given extra infantry in relation to the number of countries and contents that are under their control.

## Implementation
We will be implementing this game using the following technologies. React.js and Redux will be used for Frontend for powerful client-side rendering and easier state management. Our implementation of the game will feature a Django backend and a MySQL relational database to store game data and user information. Amazon Web Services will be used as the Provider and Github Actions as CI/CD.

## Features

- The general game play rules
- A responsive desgin that is easy to use on all screens
- A track of current highscores
